## Integration with lpm-cli

The lpm-cli tool can listen to changes in a snippet and create a React Native component file on the fly.

To install:
```sh
npm install -g lpm-cli
```

To listen to component "F19nfan" (important: see NOTE):
```sh
lpm-cli -s F19nfan -f Component.js
```
NOTE: use with cauton. The Component.js is overwritten everytime you make a change in htmlbin.com.

## Incentive    
This is part of the [lpm](https://github.com/dht/lpm) project. The goal is to provide tools and specifications for cross-format layout development.

## Contribution
Highly welcomed. To run locally install all the dependencies:

dev:
```sh
npm install
```

peer:
```sh
npm install react@^15.4.1 react-dom@^15.4.1
```
